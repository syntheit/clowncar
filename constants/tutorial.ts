    description:
      "Random access memory stores information about your computer while it is currently running. However, this memory is volatile, and is lost when your computer loses power.

Destruction of RAM is unnecessary and simply generates more waste.",

      "Hard drives should always be wiped before giving them away or donating. Your computer's hard drive stores all your files and user data, along with system information. This data should be backed up and wiped off the hard drive in a secure manner. The United States Department of Defense has released a standard protocol for this procedure, known as the DoD 5220.22-M Wipe Standard. There are both free and paid software packages available to perform this secure wipe sequence:  https://www.minitool.com  https://www.cbldatarecovery.com/data-shredder  https://eraser.heidi.ieMany tools also verify that data has been fully wiped. This process can take several hours, but it ensures that your privacy and security is maintained when your hard drives are given to others.",
